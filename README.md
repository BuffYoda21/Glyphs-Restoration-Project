A work in progress collection of mods restoring various scrapped content from Glyphs

This repository has two main mods planned for it. One restoring the origninal game ending and one restoring another scrapped region originally planned to be added in Glyphs v1.5

# Old Ending Restoration
Restores the game's original ending.

## Implemented:
- Sets the region to active and moves it to a place where you can see it on the map in the bottom right corner (compatible with Glyphs v1.2+)
- Adds a floor to the start of the region and a save button that is always active (compatible with Glyphs v1.2+)
- Fixes camera bug when entering the lava rising room (only compatible with Glyphs v1.2 - v1.6 for now)
- Updates pre-existing save button logic so you can warp to it
- Adds logic that makes the region acessable after all 15 silver shards are collected

## Planned:
- Update LavaRising trigger so the door closes properly, and boss preforms it's proper animation
- Fix boss hitbox

# Shattered Region Restoration
Planned but not started

# Installation Instructions
1) Download MelonLoader at https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.7.0 I recommend using the cooresponding MelonLoader.Installer for your OS over the other options because it makes your life easier.
2) Run the installer, click "Add Game Manually", then navigate to your Glyphs executable.
3) Download the latest release of the mod at: https://github.com/BuffYoda21/Glyphs-Restoration-Project/releases/tag/v0.2.0-Beta
4) MelonLoader will create a bunch of additonal files and folders in your Glyphs folder and once it is done, drag and drop your OldEndingRestoration.dll into the Mods folder (make sure you download the correct version of the mod for your game version!).
5) Run the game.

# Credits
I did not make MelonLoader, I am just a guy who made mods that run on their program. Any and all credit for MelonLoader goes to the creators of MelonLoader.
